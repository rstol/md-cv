<!-- ## Currently
I’m a Computer Science student at ETH Zürich shortly before graduation and looking to work as a software developer skillfully realizing ideas. I enjoy finding solutions that make hard problems seem simple by using effective abstractions.
In the fall of 2022, I took a gap semester to fulfill my dream of traveling the world for 6 months. This has taught me many life skills as flexibility, negotiation, self-sufficiency, and improvisation. -->
