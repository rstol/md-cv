## Currently

I’m a Computer Science student at ETH Zürich shortly before graduation and looking to work as a software developer in product and customer-centric projects focusing on quality and fast iteration speeds.

I enjoy finding solutions that make hard problems seem simple by using effective abstractions. I love to come up with my own goals and their execution as a manager of one.

In the last six months, I took a gap semester to fulfill my dream of traveling the world for an extended time. This has taught me many life skills as flexibility, negotiation, self-sufficiency, and improvisation.

## Projects

### The future of computing

`2021-22`
In this _IBM Academy Initiative_ seminar I worked with D. Vetter on analyzing the future of computing. We presented our analysis of the computing technologies: Quantum, Neuromorphic, and In-Memory in a company-representative presentation, a presentation before the CAS in Applied Information Technology graduates, and an internal company blog post.

`2016-17`
I participated in the _Young Enterprise Switzerland Company Program_ leading the _flavourized_ team of 5 classmates. Our startup developed a bottle that made drinking water more fun. We raised funds from individual investors and sold directly to customers online and at events using a custom sales booth.

I write a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io/blog) where I apply R and Python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. My original wordpress blog ([benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com](http://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com)) has received over 150,000 unique visitors from 180 countries.
