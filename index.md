## Currently

I'm a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at [Illumina](http://www.illumina.com/), based at their R&D site near Cambridge in the UK. Here I work on solutions to key informatics hurdles in the sequencing space, such as efficient and automated bioinformatics data analysis. I enjoy solving hard problems by writing quality software, preferably leveraging modern programming languages, agile development practices and effective cloud services.

## Employment

__Illumina, Inc.__ Senior Bioinformatics Scientist (software engineer and solutions architect). 
> My work includes integrating Illumina's best-in-class _DRAGEN_ bioinformatics analysis pipelines with our flagship cloud platforms (_BaseSpace Sequence Hub_ and _Illumina Connected Analytics_). I also develop public tools such as the BaseSpace Sequence Hub Commandline Interface, alongside many other internal software engineering projects ranging from bioinformatics scripts to web applications.

`2015-20` 
__Illumina, Inc.__ Bioinformatics Scientist (data scientist and statistical programmer).
> I joined Illumina's R&D organisation in 2015 where I worked on a wide range of bioinformatics and data science projects. Some public-facing work focused on variant comparison and analysis tooling, and I also advanced the popular _Platinum Genomes_ gold-standard variant truthset by introducing novel validation methods.

## Education

`2012-15`
__University of Edinburgh__ Bioinformatics PhD (supervisors: Colin Semple and Stuart Aitken). My thesis was titled _Unravelling higher order chromatin organisation through statistical analysis_ and is available through the [Edinburgh Research Archive](https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/22906).

## Projects

### The future of computing
`2021-22`


### flavourized.
`2016-17` 
I participated in the _Young Enterprise Switzerland Company Program_ leading the _flavourized_ team of 5 classmates. Our startup developed a bottle that made drinking water more fun. We raised funds from individual investors and sold directly to customers online and at events using a custom sales booth.

### EdinbR

I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I helped to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR).

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account.
